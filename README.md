### My Process


 Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- 
### What I learned

- I learnt how to use margin and padding effectively(not too much or too small).
- I learnt how to use media query with relative to screen sizes(mobile and deskop)

Code snippets:
```html


```css media query for mobile deices*/
@media (min-width:600px){
    .qr-scan{
        font-size:1.25rem;
    background:pink; 
}

    }
    .title{
        font-size: 1.5rem;
        color: blue;

    }
/* media  query for desktop devices*/

@media (min-width:992px){
    .title{
      font-size: 1.5rem;
      line-height: 1.3;
      color: black;
   
  }
  .qr-scan{
    font-size: 1.25rem;
    color: black;
    background: white;

}
}
- I learnt how to use colors moderately


### Continued Development

- Media query
- Responsive designs


### Useful resources
